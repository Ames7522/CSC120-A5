- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


It was hard to try to find the right associations and trying to avoid adding uneccessary features. Finding the methods that fit whith which classes took a bit of drawing board time but a diagram made it overall really helpful.

What worked: a whiteboard and making time to just relax and think of it as actual objects/components in a toy rather than a program. Having physical objects to try to find connections worked really well. The documentation and other examples of the JavaDocs worked really well for me. 

Advice: get ducks or toys or any type of physical objects to try to visualise the connections with yarn and a whiteboard. Trying to see it all in your head wont be too helpful for everyone.
